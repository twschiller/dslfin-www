== Financial Domain-Specific Language Listing

The goal of this page is to provide a comprehensive listing of
financial domain-specific languages and resources. Please send additional
resource suggestions to mailto:tschiller@finlingua.com[Todd Schiller].

=== Actulus Modeling Language (AML)

The goal of the Actulus project is to "establish a platform for definition of
advanced life insurance and pension products and for efficient
computations on them." Actulus is a joint effort between the the IT
University of Copenhagen and Edlund A/S. The project uses QuantAlea
(see below) for GPU kernel creation.
